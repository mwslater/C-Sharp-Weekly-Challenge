# Week 6 Challenge
### Focusing On:
#### LINQ

Build and Run the enclosed program - it should load data from CSV files into memory. 

There are several questions posed, but no answers.  

See if you can use LINQ to answer the questions. 

You could also try using standard foreach loops to answer one of the tougher
questions, just to see how hard it can be and how awesome LINQ is. 

Questions - @sunny.gulati on slack.
